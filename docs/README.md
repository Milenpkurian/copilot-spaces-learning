# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome! This README serves as the central entry point for all project management process documentation at OctoAcme and within this Copilot Space. Here you'll find a high-level summary of our standardized workflows, the personas who bring them to life, and direct links to every major process doc.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme’s project management system orchestrates cross-functional projects through a clear lifecycle: initiation, planning, execution, release, retrospective, and continuous improvement. Our workflow starts with validating business needs, identifying stakeholders, and setting measurable outcomes via a standardized project one-pager. The planning stage breaks work into shippable increments, schedules key milestones, and actively documents risks, dependencies, and the definition of done—so responsibilities and deliverables are always transparent.

Roles and responsibilities are well-defined: 
- **Project Managers** coordinate delivery, risk, and communication.
- **Product Managers** shape product outcomes and prioritize the backlog.
- **Developers** and **QA** collaborate to deliver and validate features against acceptance criteria.
- **Stakeholders** participate in decision stages and approvals.

Our rhythm emphasizes communication and rapid feedback. Daily standups and weekly syncs reinforce progress and unblock issues; project boards track work status transparently. Well-established escalation paths and regular stakeholder updates foster trust and speed up risk resolution.

Quality assurance is embedded at every step: automated and manual tests, security scans, PR standards, and measurable success metrics. After every milestone or release, teams run retrospectives to review outcomes and track iterative improvements—feeding their learnings back into these living docs and supporting a culture of ongoing excellence.
